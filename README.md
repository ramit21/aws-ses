# aws-ses
**Send mail via SES using HTML templates, using terraform to configure SES**



Execute mail sending code:

1. 'npm install aws-sdk' (or just npm install on root folder of poc as package.json has aws-sdk dependency)
2. 'npm run dev' which as per package.json runs 'node send_email.js'

You can also define templates within SES:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-personalized-email-api.html

SES by default works in Sandbox mode which has few restrictions. Refer this link for the restrictions and how to request for complete access:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html

In Sandbox mode, the 'to' address can only be from emails registered with SES. Be it sandbox or regular account, 'From' address is always from registered email addresses.
